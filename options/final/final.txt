[SUCCESS] CONGRATULATIONS, OPERATOR!!!

You have successfully infiltrated the OBC, overridden the EPS subsystem, and executed a devastating command injection.

[INFO] The satellite's defense network is falling apart...

[DATA]
[STATUS] Scanning network integrity...
[STATUS] Propulsion systems offline...
[STATUS] Communications subsystems compromised...
[STATUS] EPS (Electrical Power System) shut down...

The evil satellite network is crumbling. Without the EPS, the compromised satellite is drifting out of control, and its communications are vulnerable to further exploitation.

[MISSION REPORT] Network Compromise Confirmed

[INFO] Status: Complete
You have successfully compromised the target satellite and unleashed a cascading failure across the entire satellite network of the sinister "Dark Orbit" consortium.

[INFO] Critical satellites have gone dark. All remote surveillance and weapons systems operated by the "Dark Orbit" network are now disabled.

The galaxy has been liberated from this oppressive force.

[INFO] As the satellite burns up in Earth's atmosphere, the network's encrypted data core is extracted and sent back to headquarters for further decryption.

[INFO] Decryption protocols engaged. Analysis in progress...

[ACTION] Prepare for future missions, Operator. The fight for the galaxy has only just begun...

[END TRANSMISSION]
